Where the air is clear, and the road is straight
All the choices have been made
I'll keep rollin' right along
Leaning on a travelin' song

Seeing things that just ain't' there
Five hours away from anywhere
Highway 80 way out west
Can't afford to get no rest
Bolt of lightning up on high
Rips the darkness from the sky
Behind the wheel where I belong
Leaning on a travelin' song

I can't recall the past ten miles
Standing still feels like I'm flyin'
That old moon is shining bright
Keep her steady, lord keep it right
Traverse City to Santa Fe
Sacramento on down to Tampa Bay
Cruising through the early dawn
Leaning on a travelin' song

I'm leaning on a travelin' song
Listening to a highway prayer
Gonna be a long time gone
If I ever make it there
Where the air is clear and the road is straight
All the choices have been made
I'll keep rollin' right along
Leaning on a travelin' song

I'll keep rollin' right along
Leaning on a travelin' song

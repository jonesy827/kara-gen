Remember the time we were both eye to eye
And we both knew the reasons why
It seemed like we faced the world on our own
Before we collide can we just take a moment
Collecting reflections of this
And remember the paths that we chose

Spring lied to us this year again
I can't stand to face the fear again
But you could always laugh about those things
It's enough to make a man feel sour
Burning minutes every day by the hour
Just to end up gone like everything else

Let go of the pain and hold onto the rhythm
It's consciously held back in you
You're drowning a sorrow that's long been at rest
The past is a hell, it can creep up inside you
So let me remind you of this
It's the reason your troubles exist

Spring lied to us again this year
And still I can't stand to face the fear
Will you always laugh about those things?
It's enough to make a man stay humble
Every day is just a new chance to stumble
Just to end up gone like everything else

If ever a time comes around in the wheel
To replace where we stand side by side
We'll be ready and able to fly
Away from the mire
And the senseless decisions of somebody's wasted desire
Through the smoke and the wind and the fire

Spring lied to us this year again
I can't stand to face the fear again
But you could always laugh about those things
It's enough to make a man feel sour
Burning minutes every day by the hour
Just to end up gone like everything else

Remember the time we were both eye to eye
And we both knew the reasons why
It seemed like we faced the world on our own
Before we collide can we just take a moment
Collecting reflections of this
And remember the path that we chose

Spring lied to us this year again
I can't stand to face the fear again
Will you always laugh about those things?
It's enough to make a man feel sour
Burning minutes every day by the hour
Just to end up gone like everything else
